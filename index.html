                  (and certainly every one that has been published), almost every email have ever written
                   has been written on machines created by apple. Hi interacted online using an apple machine 
                   long before I ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped me to realize this Star Trek future 
                   I dreamed of as a kid and through his vision. I have been able to realize my own. 
                   you will be missed Mr. jobs. Banks thanks for all your amazing work.<br>
